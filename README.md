Creates ~8 large cookies or 16 small ones.

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.

2. Cream butter and sugars, once creamed, combine in the egg and vanilla.

3. Sift in the flour and salt, then the chocolate chips.

4. Roll into lemon sized balls and then flatten out to about 2cm thick. The cookies don't melt
   down much during baking due to the flour content.

5. Place on ungreased baking paper. Bake for 8 mins.

6. Take out of the oven and leave to harden for a minute before transferring to
   a wire cooling rack. These are great warm, and they also store well, if they
   don't all get eaten straight away!


# Results

- The reduced butter & extra egg helps make the final result a little lighter which helps.
