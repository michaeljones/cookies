Creates 12 "cookies". This is is an alternative recipe that doesn't include self-raising flour
(because I didn't have any) and so the cookies don't really 'settle' they just baked as little
mounds instead.

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.

2. Cream butter and sugars, once creamed, combine in the egg and vanilla.

3. Sift in the flour and salt, then the oats & cocoa powder.

4. Roll into golf-ball sized balls and place on the baking paper.

5. Place on ungreased baking paper. Bake for 8 mins.

6. Take out of the oven and leave to harden for a minute before transferring to
   a wire cooling rack. These are great warm, and they also store well, if they
   don't all get eaten straight away!


# Results

- As noted they stay in little mounds.
- They aren't that sweet in comparison to some. 
- Still very chocolate-y.
